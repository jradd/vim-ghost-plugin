Writing posts

Blog posts in Ghost are written using Markdown. Markdown is a minimal
syntax for marking up documents with formatting using punctuation and
special characters. It's syntax is intended to prevent interuptions to
the flow of writing, allowing you to focus on your content, rather than
how it looks.

Markdown Guide
Markdown is a markup language designed to improve the efficiency in
which you can write, whilst keep the writing as easy-to-read as
possible.

Ghost uses all the default Markdown shortcuts plus a few of our own
additions. The full list of shortcuts is listed below.

Headers

Headers can be set using a hash before the title text. The number of
hashes before the title text determines the depth of the header. The
headers depths are from 1-6.

H1 : # Header 1
H2 : ## Header 2
H3 : ### Header 3
H4 : #### Header 4
H5 : ##### Header 5
H6 : ###### Header 6
Text Styling

Links : [Title](URL)
Bold : **Bold**
Italic : *Italic*
Paragraphs : Line space inbetween paragraphs
Lists : * An asterix on every new list item
Quotes : > Quote
Code : `code`
HR : ==========
Images

To insert an image into your post, you need to first enter ![]() into
the Markdown editor panel. This should create an image upload box in
your preview panel.



You can now drag and drop any image (.png, .gif, .jpg) from your Desktop
over the image upload box to include it into your post, or alternatively
click the image upload box to use a standard image upload popup. If you
would prefer to include an image url, click the 'link' icon in the
bottom left of the image upload box, this will then present you with the
ability to insert an image URL.



To title your image, all you need to do is place your title text
inbetween the square brackets, e.g; ![This is a title]().

Removing Images


To remove an image click the 'remove' icon, in the top right corner of
the currently inserted image. This will present you with the blank image
upload box for you to re-insert a new image.
